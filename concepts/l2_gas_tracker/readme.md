# L2 Gas Price Tracker - Proof of Concept
This uses an ethereum-etl fork (WIP - normal ethereum-etl will also work) to stream transactions and blocks to a local postgres database. There is then a query that interprets this data to show the latest base fee, and create slow, medium, fast estimates for priority fees. This output can then be shown in a regularly updating dashboard or frontend site.

- `transactions_initialize.sql`: SQL for generating the transactions table in postgres
- `blocks_initialize.sql`: SQL for generating the blocks table in postgres
- `optimism_etl_stream.ipynb`: Python notebook to run ethereum-etl streaming and post results to a database
- `gas_tracker_query.sql`: SQL query that pulls the last day of data and creates rolling gas price estimates (Last 30 L2 Blocks). The most recent block in the result is the "current" recommendation.
- `l2_gas_estimator_output.csv`: Results of `gas_tracker_query.sql` in a csv.

This script also references `ethereumetl_utils.py` and `web3py_utils.py` which can be found in [op-analytics/helper-functions](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-analytics/tree/main/helper_functions).

**Unsolved (not a blocker):** If we want to show average cost for various transaction types, we'd also need an [ETH/USD price feed](https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?ids=ethereum&vs_currencies=USD) that we can read from (just the latest price).

**Notes:**
- With ethereum-etl, we could also pull logs, token transfers, etc. But for the gas tracker, we only need blocks and transactions.
