    # TODO: Implement the following pipeline steps:

    # Step 1: Load Data Sources
    # Intent: Load chain metadata from multiple BigQuery data sources using standardized loaders:
    # - op_stack_chain_metadata from api_table_uploads (OP Labs source, source_rank=1)
    # - Goldsky chain usage data from daily_aggegate_l2_chain_usage_goldsky (OP Labs source, source_rank=1)
    # - L2Beat activity data from daily_l2beat_l2_activity (L2Beat source, source_rank=2)
    # - L2Beat metadata extended from l2beat_metadata_extended (L2Beat source, source_rank=1.9)
    # - GrowThePie activity data from daily_growthepie_l2_activity (GrowThePie source, source_rank=3)
    # - Dune transaction data from dune_all_txs (Dune source, source_rank=4.5)
    # - DefiLlama chain TVL data from daily_defillama_chain_tvl (DefiLlama source, source_rank=5)
    # - Manual mappings file for known corrections/overrides and special case handling
    # Each source loader should return standardized DataFrames with consistent core columns
    # Design allows easy addition of new data sources by implementing the standardized interface
    # Note: Some sources will have unique metadata fields (e.g., L2Beat stage, DA layer) that others lack
    log.info("Step 1: Load Data Sources - Not yet implemented")

    # Step 2: Preprocess Individual Sources
    # Intent: Clean and standardize each data source individually before combining:
    # - Generate chain_key column (hash of chain_name for grouping similar names)
    # - Standardize chain_id column (ensure consistent format, handle known collisions)
    # - Apply source-specific transformations and data type conversions
    # - Normalize chain names and symbols for consistency across sources
    # - Apply "best display name" selection logic (e.g., prefer "Arbitrum One" over "Arbitrum")
    # - Handle special cases through repeatable functions (e.g., Celo L1->L2 transition)
    # This preprocessing ensures each source is standardized before entity resolution
    log.info("Step 2: Preprocess Individual Sources - Not yet implemented")

    # Step 3: Combine Preprocessed Sources
    # Intent: Concatenate all preprocessed source DataFrames into unified dataset:
    # - Union all preprocessed source_dfs into all_sources_df using pd.concat()
    # - Maintain source attribution and ranking for later prioritization
    # - Log total records combined from all sources
    # - Result is a comprehensive dataset ready for entity resolution
    log.info("Step 3: Combine Preprocessed Sources - Not yet implemented")

    # Step 4: Entity Resolution (Most Complex Step)
    # Intent: Generate unified_key and apply manual mappings to resolve chain entities:
    # - Create unified_key column combining chain_id, chain_key, and display_name logic
    # - Apply manual mappings to correct data inconsistencies and handle edge cases
    # - Use metadata file approach for special cases (e.g., Celo -l2 suffix) rather than hardcoded logic
    # - Handle chain_id collisions through sophisticated matching algorithms
    # - Manual mappings applied BEFORE grouping to ensure correct entity resolution
    # Success of this step depends heavily on quality of preprocessing in Steps 1-2
    log.info("Step 4: Entity Resolution - Starting implementation with manual mappings")

    # Example of how manual mappings would be integrated:
    # When Step 4 is implemented, it would include:
    # combined_df = ... # Result from Step 3
    #
    # # Apply manual mappings to resolve special cases and data inconsistencies
    # resolved_df = apply_mapping_rules(combined_df, manual_mappings)
    #
    # # Continue with unified_key generation and entity resolution
    # resolved_df = resolved_df.with_columns([
    #     # Generate unified_key for entity resolution
    #     pl.coalesce([
    #         pl.col("chain_id"),
    #         pl.col("chain_key"),
    #         pl.col("display_name").str.to_lowercase().str.replace_all(r"[^\w]+", "")
    #     ]).alias("unified_key")
    # ])

    log.info("Step 4: Entity Resolution - Manual mapping integration ready")

    # Step 5: Deduplication and Attribute Merging
    # Intent: Group by unified_key and merge attributes using source prioritization:
    # - Group records by unified_key (represents same chain entity)
    # - Within each group, sort by source_rank (lower rank = higher priority)
    # - Select primary record from highest priority source
    # - Aggregate temporal fields: min_dt_day (min), max_dt_day (max)
    # - Concatenate tracking fields: data_sources, all_chain_keys
    # - Apply secondary deduplication using is_dupe logic for remaining duplicates
    # - Results in one canonical record per unique chain entity
    log.info("Step 5: Deduplication and Attribute Merging - Not yet implemented")

    # Step 6: Field Enrichment
    # Intent: Enhance deduplicated data with additional metadata fields:
    # - Load op_stack_chain_metadata specifically for enrichment (not as competing source)
    # - Left join with deduplicated data on chain_id using flexible matching logic
    # - Coalesce/add fields: gas_token, da_layer, public_mainnet_launch_date, etc.
    # - Calculate derived fields: provider_entity_w_superchain, eth_eco_l2l3, etc.
    # - Alternative approach: Join back to original datasets using chain aliases for field extraction
    # - Integration point for registry ingestion and manual mapping outputs
    # - Apply business logic overrides using metadata file configurations
    log.info("Step 6: Field Enrichment - Not yet implemented")

    # Step 7: Data Quality Validation
    # Intent: Perform comprehensive error checking and data quality validation:
    # - Detect potential duplicates (exact matches or high similarity across columns)
    # - Validate data consistency and completeness
    # - Check for unexpected chain_id collisions or mapping conflicts
    # - Generate data quality reports and warnings
    # - Flag records requiring manual review
    # - Ensure final dataset meets quality standards before output
    log.info("Step 7: Data Quality Validation - Not yet implemented")

    # Step 8: Output to BigQuery
    # Intent: Write the final validated metadata to BigQuery with comprehensive logging:
    # - Format final DataFrame according to target BigQuery schema requirements
    # - Perform final data validation before writing
    # - Write to specified BigQuery table using write_full_df_to_bq with if_exists='replace'
    # - Log detailed success/failure status and record counts
    # - Update processing metadata and create comprehensive audit logs
    # - Generate summary statistics and data lineage information
    log.info("Step 8: Output to BigQuery - Not yet implemented")
