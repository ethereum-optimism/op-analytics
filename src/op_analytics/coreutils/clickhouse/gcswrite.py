    THIS FUNCTIONS IS EXPERIMENTAL. HAS NOT BEEN USED IN PRODUCTION YET.

    IMPORTANT: The parquet files written to GCS will have an additional "_partpath" column
    containing the full path of the partitions in GCS, e.g. "/chain=op/dt=2025-02-16".

    This is because ClickHouse doesn't support "hive-partitioned" writes, where column values
    are set as part of the  GCS path name. Instead, ClickHouse accepts a single {_partition_id}
    placeholder that we take advantage of to create hive partitions by using "_partpath".

    To avoid having fields both in the parquet files and on the partition path we use the
    EXCEPT() modifier on the query to drop the partition columns, which are included in
    "_partpath".

    The additional "_partpath" column will be ignored silently by BigQuery external tables
    that already exist and were created before any parquet files with "_partpath" started
    showing up in the table. This means it is possible to mix and match regular writes with
    GCS writes from ClickHouse.
