# Onchain Data Processing


At OP Labs we deal with data from more than 20 blockchains, so we needed a low cost, scalable and
maintainable way to manage data pipelines and build data models for all of them.  

Blockbatch is a data ingestion and processing pattern developed at OP Labs to address these challenges.
Let's cover the pattern in detail.
