_Flows are measured as the `total token difference * the latest known market price` for each token, summed over each app & chain combination. This seeks to filter out token price impact on TVL and isolate actual value flows. Apps which didn't have token breakdowns in DefiLlama show the difference measured in raw TVL (with token price impact), denoted by an asterisk '*'_
